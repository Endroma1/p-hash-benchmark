# Benchmark for perceptual hashes in face recognition systems

This is a project created for a thesis by the following creators.
- Martin Hafstad
- Henrik (Endroma, Heste)

## Features
- Modifies images based on a set of modifications.
- Hashes two sets of images, the ones that are given with -g -d /dir and the TEST_IMG_FOLDER variable.
- Compares hamming distance between the modifications and original images.
- Calculate results based on calculation functions.

## To do
- Create scatterplot for result calc.
- Create interface to config file for preconfiguring benchmarks.
- Create logic and obj for preconfiguring benchmarks.
